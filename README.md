A new project in the making.

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ npm test                 # runs all tests
$ npm test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

## Generators

No generators installed (yet). Installing one will populate this section in the README.

## Made with Concatapult

See [the `pult` docs](https://github.com/Concatapult/pult#readme) for adding additional modules to this boilerplate.
