# J. Christian Straubhaar-Jones' Personal Website

## Priorities and Values for this site

###### The basic priorities of this site reflect my personal values for coding best practices, namely:

1. Accessibility
  - This site uses agreed-upon tenets of accessible web design as the core design principles. The basic principles used here come from Web Accessibility in Mind (WebAIM) and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). These can be summarized using the acronym __POUR__:
    - **Perceivable** (especially to those with limited visual or auditory faculties)
    - **Operable** (for example, fully navigable without a mouse for those with limited motor skills)
    - **Understandable** (all content easily legible and comprehensible to as wide a variety of users as possible)
    - **Robust** (using widely-accepted tools to allow easy future compatibility)
  - For more information on these principles, see the resources listed under Accessibility in Sources at the end of the README. For the full list of specific web design principles I am aiming toward in this site, see specifically http://webaim.org/intro/#principles.
2. Diversity and Inclusion
  - Arguably a superset of accessibility, diversity in users can only exist when accessibility has been made a priority. Every failure to make a site accessible automatically limits the diversity of its user base. But above and beyond diversity of users,
  **finish**
3. Research / Continuous Learning
4. Adaptability

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ npm test                 # runs all tests
$ npm test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

## Generators

No generators installed (yet). Installing one will populate this section in the README.

## Made with Concatapult

See [the `pult` docs](https://github.com/Concatapult/pult#readme) for adding additional modules to this boilerplate.
